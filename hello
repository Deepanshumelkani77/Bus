i want a smart user website flow where buses running on longer routes can still be suggested to a passenger whose source & destination lie inside that route, and ETA + live tracking should be visible. Letâ€™s design the full flow step by step.

ðŸšŒ User Website Flow with Google APIs
1. User Selects Source & Destination
Use Google Places API (Autocomplete) â†’ User types their src & des.
You get lat/lng + formatted address.
ðŸ‘‰ Example:
User src = C (lat/lng)
User des = D (lat/lng)

2. Match Trips with Userâ€™s Request
In your DB, each bus trip has:
Start = A (lat/lng)
End = B (lat/lng)
Current live location (updated by Driver App).
Logic:
Use Google Directions API for the bus route (A â†’ B).
Check if C & D lie on or near that route (within X meters buffer).
Use Google Roads API or polyline check to see if C & D are on path.
ðŸ‘‰ If yes, show that bus to the user.

3. Show ETA of Bus to Userâ€™s Source (C)
Current bus location = lat/lng (from driver app).
Call Google Directions API:
origin = current_bus_latlng
destination = user_src_latlng
mode=driving

Response gives:
duration.text â†’ ETA (e.g., "12 mins")
distance.text â†’ Distance
âœ… User sees: Bus 21 arriving at your stop in 12 mins.

4. Show Live Tracking on Map
Use Google Maps JavaScript API (frontend) or react-native-maps (mobile).
Plot:
User Source (C) marker
User Destination (D) marker
Bus live location marker (updates every few seconds from backend via socket.io)
Bus route polyline (from Directions API A â†’ B)
âœ… Map shows moving bus + ETA updating in real time. make it and also make attrective UI use white color for background and other Navy blue or other colors for higlight i want professional UI .
